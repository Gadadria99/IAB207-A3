Main is protected requiring updates be pushed to a branch first, and then a pull request to main made.

1. ensure your branch is up to date with main before making any changes, pull changes from main into your branch if needed (be careful to check that changes are being pulled into your branch from main, and not the other way around).

2. make updates to your branch, and when ready create a pull request to main from your branch, add Adrian as reviewer (for now, we didn't discuss who is responsible for github admin).

3. Admin to review and approve request, at which point main is updated with changes associated with the pull request.


If you're unsure about anything it's best to check on discord, merges done incorrectly can cause loss of work if backups are not taken regularly.
